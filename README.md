Overview
Early diagnosis of skin cancer is crucial for effective treatment. This project uses a deep learning approach to automatically analyze dermoscopy images and classify them into malignant or benign categories. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals by providing a second opinion and expediting the diagnostic process.

Features
Image Preprocessing:
Resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

CNN Architecture:
Implements a convolutional neural network built from scratch and/or leverages transfer learning from pre-trained models.

Model Evaluation:
Utilizes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

Prediction Interface:
A simple script (or web interface, if implemented) for making predictions on new images.

Dataset
This project uses a dataset of dermoscopy images(HAM10000). The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features for model training and validation.

Training Set: Images with corresponding labels.
Validation/Test Set: A subset of images reserved to evaluate the performance of the model.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Model Training & Evaluation
Training Process:
The model is trained using a combination of data augmentation and regularization techniques to reduce overfitting. Early stopping and model checkpointing are implemented to save the best-performing model.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision & Recall: For assessing the quality of malignant lesion predictions.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of model predictions vs. actual labels.
